The Z-Fighters, also known as the Z-Warriors, Earth's Special Forces, or Gold Fighters, are a small group of martial artists located on Earth.1 They are a sub-team of fighters who are part of the Dragon Team and have no official leader or particular positions.0 They are responsible for defending Earth from major threats and protecting the seven mystical Dragon Balls from the hands of evil.1 The first time the Z Fighters are referred to as an actual organization is when the two Saiyans arrive on Earth. Yajirobe falsely takes credit for organizing and leading the group in a shameless attempt to obtain undeserved news publicity and free food
